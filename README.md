# FIRE_EXTINGUISHER_ROBOT
A semi-autonomous fire extinguisher robot designed to detect and extinguish fires. The robot is equipped with an IR sensor for fire detection and an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle avoidance. It is controlled wirelessly using the Blynk app on a mobile device via an ESP32 microcontroller.The robot is capable of autonomous navigation to avoid obstacles and reach fire sources. Once a fire is detected by the IR sensor, the robot triggers its fire suppression system to extinguish the flames. The robot can also be manually controlled using the Blynk app for real-time operation and monitoring.

Key Features:

Semi-autonomous operation: Autonomous navigation with manual control via the Blynk app.
Sensors: IR sensor for fire detection, ultrasonic sensor for obstacle avoidance.
ESP32 control: Wireless control and monitoring through the Blynk app.
Fire suppression: Activates the fire extinguisher mechanism when a fire is detected.
Mobile app integration: Control movement and monitor the robot remotely using the Blynk app.
Technologies Used:

Hardware: ESP32 microcontroller, IR sensor, ultrasonic sensor.
Software: Blynk app for control, C++ for programming.
Wireless communication: Blynk for remote interaction.
